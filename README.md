# Tweebar
## A twitter client that does not interfere.

![Top image](top_image.png)

Note: This application is under development.  
It resides on the desktop and the automatic timeline flows automatically so you can see Twitter without disturbing your work.
This is a Twitter client to watch. You can not "tweet", "do" or "like", but you can do a perfect job while watching Twitter!
We will restrict your actions and concentrate on your work.
You can search not only the timeline, but also.

## Require modules
- ipc

npm install ipc
